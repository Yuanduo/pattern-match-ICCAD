The source directories are organized into layers like this:

        -------------------
    3          conv
        -------------------
    2      gdsii   oasis
        -------------------
    1          misc
        -------------------
    0          port
        -------------------

Each layer uses only the layers below it.  For example, the gdsii and
oasis directories use only misc and port; they do not use each other
or conv.

At the bottom is port, the portability layer.  All #ifdefs that check
for system features are confined to this layer.  Some code in the other
layers also checks for system features like processor endianness and
the sizes of primitive types, but this is done in C++, not in the
preprocessor.

Next comes misc, for code that is not specific to this project.

Above that are gdsii, for the library and utilites dealing with the
GDSII Stream format, and oasis, for  the library and utilites dealing
with the OASIS format.

Finally at the top is conv, which contains the GDSII-to-OASIS converter.


In each directory the exported .o files are collected into a library
with the same name as the directory.  For example, the library for
directory gdsii is libgdsii.a.  All libraries are put in ../lib/.
The executables in each directory need the library of that directory
plus the libraries of the lower-level directories.

Each library has a namespace in which it defines its symbols.
This is the namespace for each directory:

    misc:   SoftJin
    gdsii:  Gdsii
    oasis:  Oasis
    conv:   GdsiiOasis

The files in port/ define their symbols in SoftJin or the global
namespace, whichever makes more sense.
