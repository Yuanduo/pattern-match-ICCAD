This directory contains the GDSII-to-OASIS converter.

gds-oasis.cc contains the bulk of the converter code.  Most of this file
is the class GdsToOasisConverter, which drives the conversion.

ptgroup.cc defines the class PointGrouper, which GdsToOasisConverter
uses to group sets of points into compact OASIS repetition
specifications.

gds2oasis.cc is a simple command-line program to invoke the converter.

convstats is a Perl script that runs gds2oasis with different sets
of options and tabulates the results.  This is for developers who want
to see how well the conversion works.

ConversionNotes describes some peculiarities of the GDSII-to-OASIS
conversion.
