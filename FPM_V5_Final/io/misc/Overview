This directory contains code that is not specific to the project
it is contained in.  Every .cc file below has a corresponding .h
file for the interface.  The .h files listed have no corresponding
.c file.

Start by reading globals.h and utils.{h,cc}.  The others are
independent of one another.


arith.cc
        Functions for integer arithmetic with checks for overflow.

buffer.h
        Defines classes Buffer, ReadBuffer, and WriteBuffer, which
        are data buffers allocated in the free store.

geometry.h
        Defines template classes Point2d and Box, for points and
        bounding boxes in two dimensions.

globals.h
        Defines standard constants and types.  This file is #included
        directly or indirectly by every other file.

gzfile.cc
        Defines class FileHandle to hide the difference between
        compressed and uncompressed files.  The commands in the gdsii
        directory use this to uncompress .gds.gz files automatically.

ptrlist.h
        Defines class PointerList<T>, a list of pointers to T objects.
        The objects are allocated in the free store and the list
        owns the objects.  That is, it will delete the objects when
        it is destroyed.

ptrvec.h
        Defines class PointerVector<T>.
        The vector equivalent of PointerList<T>.

stringpool.cc
        Defines class StringPool, a lifetime-based allocator for
        small strings.

timer.cc
        Defines class CodeTimer, for timing code segments.

utils.cc
        Miscellaneous useful tiny classes and functions.
