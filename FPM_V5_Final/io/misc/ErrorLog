loc:    Buffer constructor                              buffer.h
desc:   Simply called create() in the ctor to initialize all data members.
        But create() asserts that the buffer member is Null.

loc:    StringPool::extendAlloc()                       stringpool.cc
desc:   Always added a new block to the chain.  Should first see
        if there is a next block in the chain and it's big enough.
found:  nag

loc:    PointerVector<T> copy constructor               ptrvec.h
desc:   Misunderstanding of library routine.  Thought that
        vector<T>(size_t n) created an empty vector and only reserved
        n elements.  Actually creates an n-element vec using T's
        default constructor.

            template <typename T>
            PointerVector<T>::PointerVector (const PointerVector<T>& other)
                : vector<T*>(other.size())
            {
        So the code puts other.size() Nulls in the vector before copying
        other's elements.
symp:   segfault dereferencing the Null ptr

loc:    Box<NumberT>::operator|=()                      geometry.h
desc:   Forgot to return *this.
        Same error in operator&= etc.
