- OASIS equivalent of gds-copy:
    oas-copy [-c none|crc|checksum] [-r] [-z] src dest

- OasisParser::buildCellGraph() like the GdsParser version.
  Also provide a way to get the list of cells, like GdsParser::makeIndex()

- OasisBuilder methods:  Add filePos arg to let upper layers
  print file location with messages?  Might be better then to put all
  the args into a struct and just pass a ptr to the struct.

- Change representation of Repetition and PointList to use deltas as
  in the file?  Might turn out to be just as convenient for the upper
  layers as the offsets we now use.  Would be faster and safer --
  one less place to worry about overflows.

- Change Repetition to allow setting grid after adding points?
  More convenient for PointGrouper.  Remove the three gridded rep types
  and let OasisCreator::writeRepetition() decide which reptype to write
  based on whether the grid == 1.

- oasis-stats:  Print
    - distribution of cell sizes
    - for each rectype, number of records and distribution of record lengths
    - for each rep type, the number of reps of that type
    - for rep types 10 and 11, distribution of the number of points
