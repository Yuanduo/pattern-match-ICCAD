- retaining all bits of GDSII 8-byte reals: class GdsReal?

- ASCII representation of bit-array records:
  keyword/value pairs instead of hex number

- GdsParser: define separate handle/body classes?

- AsciiToGdsConverter: If XY coordinates are in user units
  (file written with -u), convert them back to db units

- GdsToAsciiConverter: when printing only one cell, print library header
  + trailer too?  Anything gained by making the output a complete GDSII
  file that can be converted back to binary?

- ASCII file format: remove count fields?

- gds2ascii: option to print all element records on single line
  Useful when writing scripts to process elements.

- GdsDate: add ctor?  Should setTime() return bool or throw exception
  on invalid date?  If bool, what about ctor?
